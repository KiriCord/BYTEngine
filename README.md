# BYTEngine

## When students decided to create gaming engine...

...and then run their own game on it

Sounds like a legend. But it`s true.

## What it can do:

At least, nothing yet. But it will grow!

## What we use:

+ Visual Studio Code
+ Makefile
+ C++
+ A little bit magic
+ and Google (of course, how without it?)

## Our plans

- [x] Start workind... **DONE at 7.29.2020**
- [ ] Do something... In progress
- [ ] Make it run at least with simple objects... *Do you realy believe in it?*

## How we do it? 

### We have absolutely no idea. But we`ll try it out! 

## How can you help us? (Because help is realy needed)

Any advices, help, something else you can drop in issues or you can fork this repo and
